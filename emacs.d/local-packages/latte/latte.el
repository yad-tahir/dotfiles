;;; Summary:
;;; Latte - A simple notebook manager with auto highlighting built on top of the
;;; beloved Org-mode.
;;;
;;; Author: Dr. Yad Tahir <yad (at) ieee.org>
;;; Keywords: note-taking, auto-highlighting, org-mode.
;;;
;;; Commentary:
;;; This file is part of a simple note-taking system. Notes are stored in Org
;;; files. This system scans these files on a regular basis to collect
;;; 'keywords'. Latte, then, automatically highlights keywords when the
;;; latte-mode is active. This implementation is designed to be snappy, and
;;; performs UI drawing as less as possible.

;;; Road Map and Hopes:

;;; - Remove the needs for s.el.
;;; - Add support for Helm.
